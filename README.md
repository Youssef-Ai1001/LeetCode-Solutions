## About
This repository contains LeetCode problem solutions implemented in Python. The goal is to provide readable, well-tested, and idiomatic solutions that can serve as references for learning and interview preparation.

## Repository Structure
- Solution files follow the naming pattern: `NNN. Problem Title.py` (e.g., `136. Single Number.py`).
- Each file typically contains a function or class implementing the solution and a simple example or `if __name__ == "__main__"` block to demonstrate usage.

Example files in this repo:
- `136. Single Number.py`
- `217. Contains Duplicate.py`
- `268. Missing Number.py`
- `448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array.py`
- `2022. Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array.py`

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ is recommended
- (Optional) Use a virtual environment:

## How to Run
Run a solution file directly with Python:

```bash
python "136. Single Number.py"
```

## Adding / Contributing
Contributions are welcome. When adding a new solution:
1. Add a new file following the naming convention `NNN. Problem Title.py`.
2. Include a short description of your approach in a comment at the top of the file.
3. Optionally add a small example in an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

## Style & Testing
- Keep solutions concise and readable.
- Prefer built-in data structures and standard library functions for clarity.
- Use type hints where helpful and include a brief complexity analysis when possible.
