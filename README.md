## About
This repository contains LeetCode problem solutions implemented in Python. The goal is to provide readable, well-tested, and idiomatic solutions that can serve as references for learning and interview preparation.

## Repository Structure
- Solution files follow the naming pattern: `NNN. Problem Title.py` (e.g., `136. Single Number.py`).
- Each file typically contains a function or class implementing the solution and a simple example or `if __name__ == "__main__"` block to demonstrate usage.

Example files in this repo:
- `136. Single Number.py`
- `217. Contains Duplicate.py`
- `268. Missing Number.py`
- `448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array.py`
- `2022. Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array.py`

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ is recommended
- (Optional) Use a virtual environment:

## How to Run
Run a solution file directly with Python:

```bash
python "136. Single Number.py"
```

## Adding / Contributing
Contributions are welcome — please follow these guidelines:
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch (e.g., `add/ two-sum-solution`).
2. Add a new file following the naming convention `NNN. Problem Title.py`.
3. Include a short description of your approach in a comment and example usage in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block.
4. Add tests under `tests/` when applicable.
5. Open a pull request describing the problem, approach, and any complexity analysis.

Pull requests that add new solutions should include one or more test cases illustrating typical and edge inputs.

## Style & Testing
- Keep solutions concise and readable.
- Prefer built-in data structures and standard library functions for clarity.
- Use type hints where helpful and include a brief complexity analysis when possible.

Happy coding! 💡 If you'd like, I can also add a `LICENSE` file (MIT), set up a GitHub Action for running tests, or add `pytest` configuration and sample tests. 🔧
